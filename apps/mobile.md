Wait for Svelte to release a custom renderer for Lynx.

- [Svelte Lynx Support](https://github.com/lynx-family/lynx/issues/144)
- [Svelte Custom Renderer](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/issues/15470)

Instead of using React Native Expo, it seems like [Lynx](https://lynxjs.org/) has the same
philosophy as Svelte.
